We are currently developing some accessible UKHSA branded colour palettes. For now, you may wish to use the Analysis Function palettes.

## Introduction

This guidance is intended as a practical handbook for creating charts and charts. It condenses the most relevant Government resources on data visualisation together with the Statistics Production Division's own experience producing official statistics and working with statistics producers. While the information on this page is by no means comprehensive, we hope that it provides a useful overview of best practices and how to implement them.

Good accessibility brings benefits to all users, improving the quality and value of our statistics, and the trust users have in us as an organisation. It is particularly important for people with disabilities, remembering that [20% of the working-age population report having a disability](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/the-employment-of-disabled-people-2021/the-employment-of-disabled-people-2021#:~:text=1%20in%205%20of%20the%20working%2Dage%20population%20are%20classed%20as%20disabled,-Figure%203a%3A%20Proportion&text=Source%3A%20Annual%20Population%20Survey%20%E2%80%93%20data,to%20question%201%20(see%20below)). We welcome any contributions from colleagues who may wish to share their own knowledge, charts, or code to incorporate into this document.

R code to produce a minimal reproducible example is available under each chart. They were made using a standard ggplot2 theme which can be found below. If you have any questions about our R resources or need any assistance using them, don't hesitate to email the Statistics Production Division at [UKHSA_HOPSTATS@ukhsa.gov.uk](mailto:UKHSA_HOPSTATS@ukhsa.gov.uk) and we'll be happy to help in any way that we can!

## Choosing the right chart

Charts are particularly effective when used to highlight key points in a publication [1]. You should choose the type of chart based on the type of data and the trend you are trying to show. 

This section gives some specific recommendations for presenting categorical data or time series data in an accessible way. 

### Categorical data

> Bar charts work well for comparing different categories

When making a bar chart, consider whether there is a logical ordering to the bars that groups similar categories together. For example, you could order age groups from lowest to highest or place bars to adjacent geochartical regions next to eachother. If there is no logical ordering, it is often most helpful to present bars in order of size.

Stacked or clustered bar charts can be used to display two different categorical variables in one chart. However, each individual stack or cluster should usually contain no more than four categories as a rule of thumb, to avoid clutter. This is especially the case for stacked bar charts, as a larger number of categories makes comparisons between bars much more difficult. If you have a large number of categories, it is usually best to split your data into several bar charts. The section "Avoiding cluttered charts" contains examples of ways to break down charts that contain too many categories, including reformatting them as small multiples charts.

It is best practice when making clustered bar charts to leave a small gap between each bar in a cluster to help users distinguish more easily between bars. A wider gap should be left between clusters, again to help users easily distinguish different clusters [1].

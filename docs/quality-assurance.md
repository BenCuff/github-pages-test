## Summary

> ### Main messages
> - In high quality analysis, quality assurance operates throughout the data journey and isn’t something that can just be added at the end of production
> - Quality assurance should be planned in advance, with roles, responsibilities, and the extent of assurance activities understood fully by the entire team.
> - Quality assurance should be appropriate and proportionate to the scope, risks, methodology, and data source of a piece of analysis.
> - Understanding user needs is important when measuring the quality of your data. Perfect data quality may not always be achievable and therefore focus should be given to ensuring the data is as fit for purpose as it can be.
> - Teams should make use of the [quality review conversation tool](https://confluence.collab.test-and-trace.nhs.uk/download/attachments/353007964/QA%20review%20conversation%20tool.xlsx?version=1&modificationDate=1716383304798&api=v2) to facilitate discussions around quality and help plan quality assurance, identifying gaps in current procedures.
> - A quality assurance log is a crucial tool to help teams plan, record, and sign off on quality. It provides an audit trail of everything that was checked and what the outcomes were.
> - The [quality assurance process](https://confluence.collab.test-and-trace.nhs.uk/download/attachments/353007964/QA%20log%20template%20v1.2.xlsx?version=1&modificationDate=1716383298406&api=v2) and any outstanding quality concerns should be clearly communicated alongside the final results of the analysis.


## What is quality?


The quality of an analytical output may be thought of in simple terms as its “fitness for purpose”. When data is fit for purpose, it is less likely to be misleading and we can make effective decisions using the data. The [UK Statistics Authority Code of Practice](https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/) uses the [5 Dimensions of Quality of the European Statistical System (ESS) Code of Practice](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ESS-Dimensions-of-Quality.pdf) as its criteria for assessing fitness for purpose of statistical outputs. These 5 dimensions are:

- Relevance
- Accuracy and Reliability
- Timeliness and Punctuality
- Comparability and Coherence
- Accessibility and Clarity

All quality assessments of official statistics should be conducted in line with these dimensions and both our [QA review conversation tool](https://confluence.collab.test-and-trace.nhs.uk/download/attachments/353007964/QA%20review%20conversation%20tool.xlsx?version=1&modificationDate=1716383304798&api=v2) and [QA log template](https://confluence.collab.test-and-trace.nhs.uk/download/attachments/353007964/QA%20log%20template%20v1.2.xlsx?version=1&modificationDate=1716383298406&api=v2) sets out these dimensions for you to consider.

> ## Main messages
> When publishing statistics with associated uncertainty, you should [1]:
> - Be transparent: Draw attention to any uncertainty in your reports and accompanying spreadsheets to avoid misinterpretation and misuse.
> - Be specific about what exactly is uncertain: Explain why there is uncertainty in an estimate, how the uncertainty has been quantified, the limitations of the data and any assumptions made in the analysis.
> - Indicate uncertainty using numerical ranges in parentheses after the main value: Quote numerical uncertainty in parentheses after the main value. Do this every time you give a numeric value with associated uncertainty.
> - Use plain and accessible language: Make sure that when you write about uncertainty it can be understood by all.
> - Visualise uncertainty: Show uncertainty in your data visualisations and explain to readers what the uncertainty represents.
